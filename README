A Crafty component which uses Three.js (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for 3D rendering and the Loop class from tQuery (https://github.com/jeromeetienne/tquery). The code is currently functional but a little rough around the edges. The code is in urgent need of documentation, which I plan to upload as soon as I get a chance. A loader for 3D models is included with a similar API to Crafty's own loader. Currently only .json format models are supported.

Crafty.THREE.init sets up the 3D environment and starts the rendering loop, it is configured by passing an object specifying options. A few keys to note:

* rayEnabled (boolean): if true then mouse picking using THREE.Ray will be enabled
* rayConstant (boolean): if true then the ray will be cast each frame (used for mouseover/mouseout). This may be slow with a lot of objects on screen, I am planning to add options to set an interval instead of casting every frame.
* screenNoContextMenu (boolean): if true then the context menu event is prevented from firing when the user right-clicks on the canvas element

Better documentation, unit tests and a much more extensive example will follow soon.
